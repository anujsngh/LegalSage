[{"document_id": 1, "content": "Noharlal Verma v District Co-Operative Central Bank Limited, Jagdalpur\nSupreme Court of India\n\n20 October 2008\nCivil Appeal No. 6161 of 2008 Arising Out of Special Leave Petition (Civil) No. 16541 of 2005\nThe Judgment was delivered by: C. K. Thakker, J.\n1. Leave granted.\n2. The present appeal is directed against judgment and order passed by the Division Bench of the High Court of Chhattisgarh on May 04, 2005 in Writ Petition No. 283 of 2001. By the said order, the High Court dismissed the Writ Petition filed by the appellant-petitioner and confirmed the order passed by the Madhya Pradesh State Co-operative Tribunal, Bhopal on January 22, 2001 in Second Appeal No.560 of 1999.\n3. Short facts giving rise to the present appeal are that the appellant herein was working as Manager in the Large Area Multi- Purpose Society ('LAMPS' for short). Between August, 1977 and August, 1981, the appellant was the Manager in the Schedule Tribe Service Co-operative Society, Kanker. He, at that time, committed financial irregularities. Disciplinary proceedings were initiated against him and by an order dated April 29, 1982, passed by the Chairman, District Co-operative Central Bank Ltd., Jagdalpur (Bastar), he was removed from service.\n4. The appellant preferred a departmental appeal on April 30, 1982. Since he had not been communicated anything as to what had happened to the said appeal, the appellant on June 30, 1982 filed an application u/s. 55 of the Madhya Pradesh Co- operative Societies Act, 1960 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act') to the Joint Registrar, Co-operative Societies, Raipur.\n5. According to the appellant, the application was made to the Joint Registrar, Raipur as District Bastar/Jagdalpur was within the territorial jurisdiction of Raipur. As stated by the petitioner, Joint Registrar then came to be appointed for District Bastar for Jagdalpur Area. Another application was, therefore, made on October 08, 1985 by the petitioner before the Joint Registrar, Co-operative Societies, Jagdalpur. On February 19, 1986, the Joint Registrar, Jagdalpur dismissed the application filed by the petitioner as time barred. The appellant preferred an appeal against the said order before the Board of Revenue, Gwalior. However, the said appeal was also dismissed by the Board on June 14, 1990.\n6. On October 22, 1990, the application filed by the petitioner on June 30, 1982 before the Joint Registrar, Raipur was forwarded to Deputy Registrar, Kanker for adjudication. The Deputy Registrar, Kanker treated the case as within the period of limitation, considered it on merits and set aside the order of removal vide his order dated May 18, 1994. He also directed the Bank to pay all dues to the applicant.\n7. The respondent Bank challenged the said order by approaching the State Co- operative Tribunal. The Tribunal allowed the appeal filed by the Bank on the ground of res judicata observing that an application filed by the appellant was dismissed by Joint Registrar, Jagdalpur and the said order was confirmed by the Board of Revenue, Gwalior dismissing the appeal which had become final.\n8. The appellant being aggrieved by the order passed by the Tribunal preferred Writ Petition No. 283 of 2001 in the High Court of Chhatisgarh, which as stated above, was dismissed by the High Court. The said order is challenged in the present appeal.\n9. On July 06, 2006, notice was issued to the respondents. Affidavit-in-reply and affidavit-in-rejoinder were thereafter filed. An order was passed directing the Registry to place the matter for final hearing and that is how the matter has been placed before us.\n10. We have heard the learned counsel for the parties.\n11. The learned counsel for the appellant contended that the Tribunal as well as the High Court were wrong in dismissing the claim of the appellant. It was contended that the Tribunal was not right in holding that the appeal filed by the appellant was barred by res judicata. The High Court was, therefore, right in observing that the Tribunal committed an error of law in treating the appeal as barred by res judicata.\nThe High Court, however, went wrong in not allowing the writ petition and in coming to the conclusion that the application filed by the appellant/petitioner u/s. 55 of the Act was barred by limitation and the Registrar had no power, authority or jurisdiction to entertain such dispute. The counsel contended that when the matter came up before the Tribunal, it was stated on behalf of the respondent-Bank through its counsel that the application was 'within time' and hence, it was decided on merits. Thereafter, it was not open to the Bank to contend that the application was beyond time and delay could not be condoned.\n12. The learned counsel submitted that even on merits, the case did not call for punishment of removal. Certain allegations were made and even if it is assumed for the sake of argument that all the allegations were true, the appellant could not have been removed from service. No financial loss has been caused to the respondent-Bank. The appellant has enormously suffered and he is out of employment since more than fifteen years.\nHence, even if this Court comes to the conclusion that proceedings could have been initiated against the appellant and he could have been punished, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, this Court may direct the Bank to re- instate the appellant without back wages so that the appellant as well as his family members would not be deprived of livelihood and would not starve.\n13. The learned counsel for the respondent-Bank, on the other hand, supported the order passed by the Tribunal and confirmed by the High Court. It was contended that the High Court was right in holding that the application filed by the appellant was barred by limitation. The counsel urged that the Act provides by laying down maximum period of limitation beyond which no application can be entertained by the Registrar. If it is so, no grievance can be made if the application filed by the appellant was treated as barred by time.\n14. The counsel did not seriously challenge the view taken by the authorities that the application could not be dismissed on the ground of res judicata but submitted that the application was time barred.\n15. The counsel also submitted that the Deputy Registrar, Co-operative Societies, Kanker was not right when he stated that consent was given by the counsel appearing on behalf of the Bank that the application filed by the appellant u/s. 55 of the Act be treated within time and the application was admitted. The counsel, however, stated that even if the counsel for the Bank had stated that the application submitted by the appellant could be treated within the period of limitation, such concession being concession against law would not bind the Bank. If the statute stipulates a particular period of limitation, no concession or order would make an application barred by time to be within the limitation and the authority had no jurisdiction to consider such application on merits.\n16. On merits, the counsel urged that considering the totality of facts and circumstances, particularly, charges levelled against the appellant and proved at the inquiry which related to financial irregularities, if the appellant was removed from service, it cannot be said that no order of removal could have been passed. The appellant was a Bank employee and holding the office of Manager, a position of trust. It is in the light of the said fact that his case was required to be considered which was done and punishment was imposed.\n17. Having heard the learned counsel for the parties and having applied our mind to the facts and circumstances of the case, in our opinion, the appeal filed by the appellant deserves to be dismissed. The High Court has not committed any error of law which requires to be interfered with in exercise of discretionary and equitable jurisdiction u/art. 136 of the Constitution.\n18. So far as res judicata is concerned, in our opinion, the appellant is right in submitting that the Tribunal was not justified in holding that the application filed by the appellant was barred by res judicata. It is clear from the facts stated hereinabove that the application was filed by the appellant to Joint Registrar, Raipur. It was pending.\nMeanwhile, however, District Bastar had its own Registry and hence, an application was submitted to District Registrar, Bastar. The application preferred by the appellant to the Joint Registrar, Raipur, in the circumstances, became infructuous. It was not decided on merits.\n19. As per settled law, such decision does not operate as res judicata. The High Court was, therefore, right in coming to the conclusion that the Tribunal was in error in dismissing the application on the ground of res judicata. That part of the order passed by the Tribunal was, therefore, rightly not approved by the High Court.\n20. But so far as limitation is concerned, admittedly, the disciplinary proceedings culminated against the appellant in an order of removal. Such order was passed on April 29, 1982. An application against the said order was made for the first time by the appellant/ applicant on June 30, 1982, i.e. after more than two months.\n21. Now, S. 55 of the Act empowers the Registrar to determine conditions of employment in societies. The said section, as it then stood, read as under;\n\"55. Registrar's power to determine conditions of employment in societies:\n(1) The Registrar may, from time to time, frame rules governing the terms and conditions of employment in a society or class of societies and the society or class of societies to which such terms and conditions of employment are applicable shall comply with the order that may be issued by the Registrar in this behalf.\nProvided that in the case of co- operative credit structure, the Registrar may frame rules governing the terms and conditions of employment on the basis of the guidelines specified by the National Bank.\n(2) Where a dispute, including a dispute regarding terms of employment working conditions and disciplinary action taken by a society, arises between a society and its employees, the Registrar or any officer appointed by him not below the rank of Assistant Registrar shall decide the dispute and his decision shall be binding on the society and its employees:\nProvided that the Registrar or the officer referred to above shall not entertain the dispute unless presented to him within thirty days from the date of order sought to be impugned:\nProvided further that in computing the period of limitation under the foregoing proviso, the time requisite for obtaining copy of the order shall be exclused.\" (emphasis supplied)\n22. Plain reading of the aforesaid provision makes it more than clear that when a dispute regarding terms of employment, working conditions and disciplinary action taken by a society and its employees arises, the officer specified therein will decide such dispute which shall be binding on the society and its employees. The first proviso to sub-s. (2) of the said section prohibits the Registrar from entertaining the dispute unless such dispute is presented to him within thirty days from the date of the order impugned.\n23. The second proviso declares that in computing the period of limitation, the time requisite for obtaining copy of the order would be excluded. It is thus clear that if an employee, aggrieved by any decision taken by the society intends to approach the Registrar, he must invoke provisions of S. 55 of the Act by filing an application within thirty days from the date of such order or action.\n24. In the instant case, admittedly, the order of removal was passed by the Bank against the appellant on April 29, 1982. Even the first petition u/s. 55 of the Act was filed by the appellant/applicant on June 30, 1982, i.e. after two months which was time- barred. The High Court considered the first petition filed by the appellant herein before the Registrar, Raipur, but even that petition was barred by time. The High Court was, therefore, right in dismissing the writ petition holding that the application filed by the applicant was not within the period of limitation prescribed by S. 55 of the Act.\n25. Learned counsel for the appellant, however, submitted that the petition filed by the applicant ought to have been treated within the period of limitation. In support of such contention, he relied on two aspects.\n26. Firstly, the provisions of appeals and revisions under the Act. Chapter X provides for filing of appeals and revisions. Referring to rule making power of the State (Section 95), the counsel submitted that the State Government has power to prescribe procedure in presenting and disposal of appeals [Cl. (gg) of sub- s. (2) of S. 95]. In exercise of the said power, the State Government has framed rules known as the Madhya Pradesh Co-operative Societies Rules, 1962 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Rules)'. Chapter IX as then stood provided procedure in \"Appeals and Revisions\". Rule 59 of the Rules laid down procedure in filing an appeal to the State Government or to the Registrar. Sub-rules (6), (7) and (8) to which our attention has been invited by the learned counsel read thus;\n\"(6) If the appellate authority finds that the appeal presented does not conform to any of the said provisions, it shall make a notice on the appeal to that effect and may call upon the appellant or his agent to remedy the defects within a period of seven days of the receipt of the notice to do so or in case the appeal has not been presented within the prescribed time limit to show cause within the said period of seven days why it should not be dismissed as time-barred by the appellate authority.\n(7) If the defect is remedies or the cause shown by the appellant or his agent satisfies the appellate authority, the appellate authority may proceed to consider the appeal.\n(8) If the appellant or his agent fails to remedy the defects or to show cause to the satisfaction of the appellate authority within the said period, the appellate authority may, if the appeal is not presented within the time-limit, dismiss the appeal as time, barred. In cases where it is considered necessary to give a hearing, the appellate authority may fix a date for hearing, of which due notice shall be given to the appellant or his agent.\"\n27. We are of the view that the aforesaid provisions do not apply to the case on hand. Apart from the fact that Rule 59 merely lays down procedure of appeals instituted within the period of limitation and provides for removal of defects, neither the provisions relating to appeals nor of revisions apply to the case on hand.\n28. In our view, the scheme of the Act is clear. Chapter X of the parent Act which deals with appeals and revisions applies to those cases where orders have been passed by the authorities and officers under the Act and a person is aggrieved by such orders. In the present case, the Action is taken not by an authority or officer under the Act but by the respondent-Bank. The appellant, therefore, rightly applied to the Registrar u/s. 55 of the Act complaining against such action.\n29. The appellant could not have preferred an appeal under the Act either to the Registrar or to the State Tribunal. The provisions of Chapter X of the Act relating to appeals and procedure laid down in Chapter IX of the Rules, therefore, had no application. The first ground in support of the application that it should be treated as within the period of limitation has thus no force.\n30. Secondly, the appellant contended that the learned counsel appearing for the Bank conceded that the application filed by the appellant/applicant was within time and hence, the Registrar took up for consideration the said application and decided on merits.\nThereafter, it was not open to the Bank to contend that the application was barred by limitation. The order of the High Court, therefore, deserves to be set aside. It was also submitted that had it been contended before the Registrar that the application was not within the period of limitation prescribed by law, the appellant could have satisfied the authority or would have taken other steps, but he was deprived by the concession on behalf of the Bank. It has caused serious prejudice to the appellant and the Bank cannot be allowed to 'blow hot and cold' by taking inconsistent pleas and by raising 'technical' defence of limitation.\n31. The learned counsel for the respondent-Bank rightly submitted that the plea raised by the appellant has no force. It was submitted that there was no concession by the Bank. Relying on Zimni, the counsel submitted that on July 06, 1993, i.e. the day on which the concession was said to have been made, the Presiding Officer was not present as he was on a tour. No proceeding took place on that day. It was, therefore, factually incorrect to state that a concession was made on behalf of the Bank and it did not object that the application was barred by time.\n32. But even otherwise, according to the counsel, if the application was not within the period of limitation, the so-called concession would neither bind the Bank nor invest jurisdiction or power in the authority to entertain such application which was barred by limitation. In other words, according to the counsel, the concession was against the provision of law, which would not bind the Bank.\n33. Now, limitation goes to the root of the matter. If a suit, appeal or application is barred by limitation, a Court or an Adjudicating Authority has no jurisdiction, power or authority to entertain such suit, appeal or application and to decide it on merits.\n34. Sub-s. (1) of S. 3 of the Limitation Act, 1963 reads as under;\n\"(3) Bar of limitation.--(1) Subject to the provisions contained in Ss. 4 to 24 (inclusive), every suit instituted, appeal preferred, and application made after the prescribed period shall be dismissed although limitation has not been set up as a defence.\" (emphasis supplied)\n35. Bare reading of the aforesaid provision leaves no room for doubt that if a suit is instituted, appeal is preferred or application is made after the prescribed period, it has to be dismissed even though no such plea has been raised or defence has been set up. In other words, even in absence of such plea by the defendant, respondent or opponent, the Court or Authority must dismiss such suit, appeal or application, if it is satisfied that the suit, appeal or application is barred by limitation.\n36. As stated earlier, S. 55 allows an aggrieved party to approach the Registrar within a period of thirty days. There is no provision analogous to S. 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963 allowing the Registrar to condone delay if \"sufficient cause\" is shown.\nIn view of this fact, in our opinion, the contention of the learned counsel for the Bank is well founded that the application submitted by the appellant was barred by time.\n37. To us, the High Court was right in observing that the Tribunal was in error in allowing the appeal and dismissing the claim of the appellant on the ground of res judicata. The High Court, therefore, considered the said question independently and held that the Bank was right in submitting that the appellant had not approached the Registrar within the period prescribed by law and his application was liable to be dismissed.\n38. So far as the prayer by the appellant that he has sufficiently suffered and should be re-instated in service without back wages also cannot be accepted. The appellant was holding position of trust and was Manager of a Bank.\n39. The charges leveled against him were serious in nature concerning misappropriation of money. It is true that the amount was not big and it was also repaid and the Bank has not suffered. But even then the Manager of a Co-operative Bank was involved in financial irregularities. The Bank was satisfied that he should not be retained in service and passed an order of removal.\n40. In our opinion, by no stretch of imagination, it can be said that such punishment is grossly disproportionate or excessively high. Normally in exercise of power of 'judicial review', a writ court will not substitute its own judgment or decision for the judgment or decision of a disciplinary authority unless it comes to the conclusion that it has shocked the conscience of the Court or the punishment is such that no 'reasonable man' would impose such punishment or in the words of Lord Scarman in Notinghamshire County Council v. Secretary of State, [1986] A.C. 240 : (1986) 1 All ER 199 that the decision is so absurd that one is satisfied that the decision maker at the time of making decision 'must have taken leave of his senses'.\n41. In our considered opinion, the case does not fall in any of the categories enumerated by the Courts in several cases. We, therefore, see no infirmity even in the final decision taken by the Bank which deserves interference by this Court.\n42. For the foregoing reasons, the appeal deserves to be dismissed and is dismissed, however, without any order as to costs.\nAppeal dismissed.\n"}, {"document_id": 2, "content": "Messrs Prestige Lights Limited v State Bank Of India\nSupreme Court of India\n\n20 August 2007\nAppeal (civil) 3827 of 2007\nThe Judgment was delivered by : C. K. Thakker, J.\nLeave granted.\n1.  The present appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated March 29, 2005 passed by the High Court of Uttaranchal at Nainital in Writ Petition No. 293 of 2005 by which the petition filed by the petitioner (present appellant) was dismissed in limned.\nTo appreciate the controversy, few relevant facts may be noted.\n2.  Appellant herein is a Private Limited Company engaged in manufacturing bulbs, chokes and fittings. The factory of the appellant is situated at Dhalwala Industrial Area, Rajpur Road, Dehradun, Uttranchal. In 1992, the appellant obtained a loan of Rs. 85 lakhs from State Bank of India, Commercial Branch, Radha Palace, Rajpur Road, Dehradun respondent herein.\n3. The Company mortgaged its land and building with the respondent-Bank. According to the appellant, till 2001, the business of the appellant was comparatively good and it had no problem in depositing the interest accrued towards credit facilities. In or about 2001-02, however, because of heavy slump in the market due to arrival of cheaper Chinese Products, the appellant suffered huge losses and could not deposit the interest-amount with the respondent-Bank.\n4. The respondent Bank, therefore, issued a notice on October 16, 2004 under sub-section (2) of Section 13 of the Securitization, Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 (hereinafter referred to \"the Act\") alleging therein that the appellant failed to pay a sum of Rs.87,64,549.42 P. It was stated that the appellant had created security by equitable mortgage of land, bearing Khasra No. 550/3 and 550/4 ad measuring 10,036 sq. ft. situated at village Jagjitpur, Pargana Jwalapur, Tehsil and District Hardwar.\n5. The notice also sought to invoke personal guarantee given by M.P. Goel, Sudha Goel and Abhinav Goel. The appellant was called upon to deposit the amount mentioned in the notice with interest, expenses and costs within sixty days failing which the Bank would exercise power under sub section (4) of Section 13 of the Act. It was also stated that the appellant should not transfer by sale, lease or otherwise the secured assets detailed in Schedule to the notice. The notice was served on the appellant-Company on October 19, 2004. It is the case of the appellant that it submitted a representation on October 20, 2004 wherein it was stated that the appellant had proposed to pay dues of the Bank after selling the land and building of the Factory.\n6. It was further stated that the appellant had proposed to regularize assets of the Company as per fixed plan. If the respondent-Bank would continue working in a healthy spirit, the appellant was confident that it would be able to regularize the assets of the Company as per the proposal. It was also stated that the Bank had a second charge on the assets of the Company and the dues to be paid to Uttar Pradesh Financial Corporation were very small and the substantial sale proceeds of the assets of the Company would automatically go to the Bank and the Bank need not take any hasty action by invoking the provisions of the Act.\n7.  It may be stated at this stage that it is the case of the respondent-Bank that it had not received any such representation said to have been sent by the appellant on October 20, 2004. According to the appellant-Company, without considering the representation of the appellant, dated October 20, 2004, the respondent-Bank in purported exercise of the power under sub-section (4) of Section 13 of the Act, threatened the appellant to take over residential premises of the Directors of the appellant-Company by a communication, dated February 8, 2005. On March 19, 2005, the respondent-Bank issued a notice to take over possession of the residential house of the Director. Being aggrieved by all these illegal actions and 'dispossession-notice', the appellant approached the High Court of Uttranchal at Nainital on March 24, 2005 by invoking writ jurisdiction of the Court under Article 226 of the Constitution. The High Court, however, dismissed the petition in limine on March 29, 2005 which constrained the Company to challenge the Action of the respondent-Bank in this Court under Article 136 of the Constitution.\n8.  It appears that a mention was made to the Court on April 28, 2005 and the Court ordered Registry to list the matter 'as notified'. Stay of dispossession was, however, granted. On May 6, 2005, notice was issued and interim relief was granted on certain terms and conditions which we will refer to at an appropriate stage. Affidavits and further affidavits were filed and the Court directed the Registry to place the matter for final hearing.\nAccordingly, the matter has been placed before us.\nWe have heard the learned counsel for the parties.\n9.  The learned counsel for the appellant contended that the Action of the respondent-Bank was wholly illegal, unlawful and against the provisions of the Act. It was also in violation of the law laid down by this Court in Mardia Chemicals Ltd. v. Union of India & Ors., (2004) 4 SCC 311 2004 Indlaw SC 258.\n10. It was submitted that once a representation was made, it was incumbent on the respondent-Bank to consider the same, to extend an opportunity to the appellant to enable the Company to pay-off the amount and in case of rejection of such representation, to inform the appellant about such decision by recording reasons. Nothing had been done by the respondent.\n11. The orders passed by the Bank, therefore, were totally illegal and unsustainable. A grievance was also made that the respondent-Bank which is 'State' within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution has acted arbitrarily and unreasonably. It ought to have appreciated the difficulties of the appellant that it was doing business in manufacturing electric goods and because of availability of Chinese Products at a cheaper rate, it suffered huge losses. Had the respondent-Bank shown sympathetic attitude and adopted constructive approach, the situation could have been avoided and the appellant- Company would have been able to pay-off the dues. No such opportunity had been granted and high handed action was taken. A complaint was also made that the High Court was wholly wrong in summarily dismissing the writ petition when several questions of power, authority and jurisdiction of respondent-Bank had been raised which required a detailed judgment.\n12. It was stated at the time of hearing that even now the appellant is prepared to pay the amount if time is granted by the respondent-Bank. But if the respondent-Bank is not prepared to show grace, this Court may set aside the Action of the Bank by granting time and allowing the appellant-Company to pay-off the entire amount.\n13.  The learned counsel for the respondent-Bank, on the other hand, supported the Action taken by the Bank and the order passed by the High Court. It was stated that there was suppression of material facts by the appellant and it has not come with clean hands. Only on that preliminary ground, this Court may decline to hear the appellant and may refuse to enter into merits.\n14. It was also submitted that no representation dated October 20, 2004 said to have been made by the appellant had been received by the respondent-Bank. According to the counsel, it was an afterthought and only with a view to take benefit of observations in Mardia Chemicals, such a case had been put forward by the appellant-Company. Grievance was also raised that apart from failure to pay regular installments, the appellant-Company has not complied with the order passed by this Court. This is, therefore, not a fit case to exercise discretionary jurisdiction in favour of the Company and the appeal deserves to be dismissed.\n15.  Having considered the rival contentions of the parties and going through the records and proceedings of the case, in our view, no case has been made out by the appellant-Company to claim any relief from this Court. It is clear from what is stated above that the appellant took a credit facility from the respondent-Bank to the extent of Rs. 85 lakhs. It is not disputed even by the appellant that no regular re-payment of loan was made by the Company. The respondent-Bank was, therefore, within its power to take appropriate action in consonance with law.\n16. Accordingly, a notice came to be issued on October 16, 2004 which was received by the Company on October 19, 2004. So far as the representation said to have been made by the appellant on October 20, 2004 is concerned, it is the case of the respondent-Bank that no such representation was made by the appellant and such stand was taken belatedly by the Company with a view to get benefit of Mardia Chemicals. In this connection our attention has been invited by the learned counsel for the respondent-Bank to an affidavit-in-reply, dated September 5, 2005 filed by D.K. Rudola, Chief Manager wherein it was stated that though the appellant had asserted that it submitted a representation on October 20, 2004 in terms of Section 13(3A) of the Act, the Bank had never received the 'alleged representation'. A letter dated October 20, 2004 written by the appellant- Company had been received by the Bank. That letter, however, did not refer to the notice and was not in reply to the notice issued by the Bank. There was no reference of notice in the said letter. In fact, it was expressly stated that the letter was with reference to 'telephonic talks' held on that day, i.e. on October 20, 2004.\n17.  The Counsel also referred to an order passed by this Court on October 24, 2005 which inter alia read as under\n\"It is stated by learned counsel appearing for the respondent, as supported by the counter affidavit that the alleged representation stated to have been made at page 55 to the respondent by the petitioner had never in fact been received by the respondent. No rejoinder has been filed. The statement made in the counter affidavit therefore till today stands un rebutted. One week's time granted to file rejoinder affidavit\".\n(emphasis supplied)\n18.  It is interesting to note that though the affidavit-in-reply was filed on September 5, 2005, wherein it was explicitly stated that no representation dated October 20, 2004 said to have been submitted by the appellant had been received by the respondent-Bank, there was no rejoinder by the appellant-Company.\n19. The said fact was pressed in service by the respondent-Bank at the time of subsequent hearing of the case and was Reflected in the order dated October 24, 2004 extracted here in above. It was only thereafter that a rejoinder affidavit was filed on November 5, 2005 in which it was asserted by the Company that the representation dated October 20, 2004 was made and was sent through courier \"First Flight Couriers Ltd.\" a reputed courier company having its office at 414-415, 2nd Floor, Sahara Trade Centre, Faizabad Road, Lucknow. Thus, there is a word against word. Moreover, this Court cannot be oblivious of the fact that it was only after the order dated October 24, 2005 passed by this Court that in rejoinder- affidavit filed in November, 2005, such a statement was made. The respondent-Bank, in the circumstances appears to be right in contending that in spite of notice issued under Section 13 (2) of the Act, neither payment was made nor a representation was submitted by the Company and only with a view to take benefit of Mardia Chemicals, as an afterthought it was alleged that in pursuance of notice issued by the respondent-Bank under sub-section (2) of Section 13 of the Act, the appellant-Company had forwarded a representation, it ought to have been considered by the respondent-Bank, a decision ought to have taken thereon by recording reasons and such decision ought to have been intimated to the appellant-Company.\n20.  It is pertinent to note at this stage that in Mardia Chemicals, constitutional validity of certain provisions of the Act had been challenged. Section 13 was one of them. It was contended that no adjudicatory mechanism for resolution of disputes had been provided by the Legislature under the said section and the provision was, therefore, ultra vires and unconstitutional.\nPartly accepting the argument of the petitioner, this Court stated;\n\"45.In the background we have indicated above, we may consider as to what forums or remedies are available to the borrower to ventilate his grievance. The purpose of serving a notice upon the borrower under sub-section (2) of Section 13 of the Act is, that a reply may be submitted by the borrower explaining the reasons as to why measures may or may not be taken under sub-section (4) of Section 13 in case of non-compliance of notice within 60 days.\nThe creditor must apply its mind to the objections raised in reply to such notice and an internal mechanism must be particularly evolved to consider such objections raised in the reply to the notice. There may be some meaningful consideration of the objections raised rather than to ritually reject them and proceed to take drastic measures under sub- section (4) of Section 13 of the Act. Once such a duty is envisaged on the part of the creditor it would only be conducive to the principles of fairness on the part of the banks and financial institutions in dealing with their borrowers to apprise them of the reason for not accepting the objections or points raised in reply to the notice served upon them before proceeding to take measures under sub-section (4) of Section\n13. Such reasons, overruling the objections of the borrower, must also be communicated to the borrower by the secured creditor. It will only be in fulfillment of a requirement of reasonableness and fairness in the dealings of institutional financing which is so important from the point of view of the economy of the country and would serve the purpose in the growth of a healthy economy.\nIt would certainly provide guidance to the secured debtors in general in conducting the affairs in a manner that they may not be found defaulting and being made liable for the unsavory steps contained under sub-section (4) of Section 13. At the same time, more importantly we must make it clear unequivocally that communication of the reasons not accepting the objections taken by the secured borrower may not be taken to give an occasion to resort to such proceedings which are not permissible under the provisions of the Act. But communication of reasons not to accept the objections of the borrower, would certainly be for the purpose of his knowledge which would be a step forward towards his right to know as to why his objections have not been accepted by the secured creditor who intends to resort to harsh steps of taking over the management/business of viz. secured assets without intervention of the court. Such person in respect of whom steps under Section 13(4) of the Act are likely to be taken cannot be denied the right to know the reason of non- acceptance and of his objections. It is true, as per the provisions under the Act, he may not be entitled to challenge the reasons communicated or the likely action of the secured creditor at that point of time unless his right to approach the Debt Recovery Tribunal as provided under Section 17 of the Act matures on any measure having been taken under sub-section (4) of Section 13 of the Act.\n46. We are holding that it is necessary to communicate the reasons for not accepting the objections raised by the borrower in reply to notice under Section 13(2) of the Act more particularly for the reason that normally in the event of non-compliance with notice, the party giving notice approaches the court to seek redressed but in the present case, in view of Section 13 (1) of the Act the creditor is empowered to enforce the security himself without intervention of the Court. Therefore, it goes with logic and reason that he may be checked to communicate the reason for not accepting the objections, if raised and before he takes the measures like taking over possession of the secured assets etc\".\nThe Court concluded;\n\"80.\n1. Under sub-section (2) of Section 13 it is incumbent upon the secured creditor to serve 60 days notice before proceeding to take any of the measures as provided under sub-section (4) of Section 13 of the Act. After service of notice, if the borrower raises any objection or places facts for consideration of the secured creditor, such reply to the notice must be considered with due application of mind and the reasons for not accepting the objections, how so ever brief they may be, must be communicated to the borrower. In connection with this conclusion we have already held a discussion in the earlier part of the judgment.\nThe reasons so communicated shall only be for the purposes of the information/knowledge of the borrower without giving rise to any right to approach the Debt Recovery Tribunal under Section 17 of the Act, at that stage\".\n21.  It may also be stated that after the above decision of this Court, Parliament amended the Act and after sub-section (3) of Section 13, sub-section (3-A) was inserted by Act 30 of 2004 with effect from November 11, 2004. The said provision reads thus;\n\"(3A) If, on receipt of the notice under sub- section (2), the borrower makes any representation or raises any objection, the secured creditor shall consider such representation or objection and if the secured creditor comes to the conclusion that such representation or objection is not acceptable or tenable, he shall communicate within one week of receipt of such representation or objection the reasons for non-acceptance of the representation or objection to the borrower:\nProvided that the reasons so communicated or the likely action of the secured creditor at the stage of communication of reasons shall not confer any right upon the borrower to prefer an application to the Debts Recovery Tribunal under section 17 or the Court of District Judge under section 17A.\"\n22.  The submission of the learned counsel for the respondent-Bank appears to be well-founded that taking clue from the decision in Mardia Chemicals, the appellant-Company, as an afterthought alleged that it had made a representation in pursuance of notice issued by the respondent-Bank under Section 13(2) of the Act.\n23.  But, there is an additional factor also as to why we should not exercise discretionary and equitable jurisdiction in favour of the appellant. It is contended by the learned counsel for the respondent-Bank that having obtained interim order and benefit the re under from this Court, the appellant-Bank has not paid even a pie. The appellant is thus in contempt of the said order. The Company has never challenged the condition as to payment of amount as directed by this Court. Thus, on the one hand, it had taken benefit of the order of interim relief and on the other hand, did not comply with it and failed to pay installments as directed. Neither it raised any grievance against the condition as to payment of installments nor made any application to the Court for modification of the condition.\n24. It continued to enjoy the benefit of stay ignoring and defying the term as to payment of money. The Company is thus in contempt of the order of this Court, has impeded the course of justice and has no right of hearing till it has purged itself of the contempt.\n25.  As already noted, stay of dispossession was granted by this Court on mention being made on April 28, 2005. The matter was then notified for admission- hearing on May 6, 2005. A two-Judge Bench of which one of us was a party (C.K. Thakker, J.) passed the following order;\n\"Permission to file additional documents is granted.\nIssue notice. Subject to the petitioner's depositing an amount of Rs.20 lakhs per month in this Court, there will be stay of the operation of the impugned order. First of such payment shall be made by 6th June, 2005 and the subsequent payments by 6th of each succeeding month. In default of payment of any one installments, the stay will stand vacated.\"\n26.  From the above order, it is clear that notice was issued to the other side and stay granted earlier was ordered to continue on the appellant's depositing a sum of Rs. 20 lakhs per month in this Court. It was also made clear that first of such payment should be made by 6th June, 2005 and subsequent payments by 6th of each succeeding month. A default clause was also introduced in the order that if such payment would not be made, the stay would stand vacated. It is an admitted fact that the order has not been complied with and no payment as per the order has been made by the appellant-Company to the respondent-Bank. The said fact has also been reflected in the order of this Court passed on July 25, 2007, wherein it was stated;\n\"It is recorded that the stay is transgressed by reason of the admitted non- compliance with the order dated 6th May, 2005\".\n27.  The original order was of May, 2005 and the matter was heard finally in May, 2007. Thus, about two years had passed and the order has been thwarted with impunity. In our opinion, therefore, the learned counsel for the respondent-Bank is right that such appellant does not deserve sympathy from the Court.\n28.  An order passed by a competent court interim or final- has to be obeyed without any reservation. If such order is disobeyed or not complied with, the Court may refuse the party violating such order to hear him on merits. We are not unmindful of the situation that refusal to hear a party to the proceeding on merits is a 'drastic step' and such a serious penalty should not be imposed on him except in grave and extraordinary situations, but some time such an action is needed in the larger interest of justice when a party obtaining interim relief intentionally and deliberately flouts such order by not abiding the terms and conditions on which a relief is granted by the Court in his favour.\n29.  In the leading case of Hadkinson v. Hadkinson, (1952) 2 All ER 567, the custody of a child was given to the mother by an interim order of the court, but she was directed not to remove the child out of jurisdiction of the Court without the prior permission of the Court. In spite of the order, the mother removed the child to Australia without prior permission of the Court. On a summons by father, the Court directed the mother to return the child within the jurisdiction of the Court. Meanwhile, an appeal was filed by the mother against that order. A preliminary objection was raised by the father that as the appellant was in contempt, she was not entitled to be heard on merits.\n30.  Upholding the contention and speaking for the majority, Roomer, L.J. observed; \"I am clearly of the opinion that the mother was not entitled, in view of her continuing contempt of court, to prosecute the present appeal and that she will not be entitled to be heard in support of it until she had taken the first and essential step towards purging her contempt of returning the child within the jurisdiction.\nIn a concurring judgment, Denning, L.J. also stated;\n\"The present case is a good example of a case where the disobedience of the party impedes the course of justice. So long as this boy remains in Australia, it is impossible for this court to enforce its orders in respect of him. No good reason is shown why he should not be returned to this country so as to be within the jurisdiction of this Court. He should be returned before counsel is heard on the merits of this case, so that, whatever order is made, this court will be able to enforce it. I am prepared to accept the view that in the first instance the mother acted in ignorance of the order, but nevertheless, once she came to know of it, she ought to have put the matter right by bringing the boy back. Until the boy is returned, we must decline to hear her appeal.\"\n31.  That, however, does not mean that in each and every case in which a party has violated an interim order has no right to be heard at all. Nor the court will refuse to hear him in all circumstances. The normal rule is that an application by a party will not be entertained until he has purged himself of the contempt.\n32. There are, however, certain exceptions to this rule. One of such exceptions is that the party may appeal with a view to setting aside the order on which his alleged contempt is founded. A person against whom contempt is alleged must be heard in support of the submission that having regard to the meaning and intendment of the order which he is said to have disobeyed, his actions did not constitute a breach of it.\n33.  In Gorden v. Gorden, (1904) 73 LJ 41 : 90 LT 597 : 16 Dig 90, 1128, Cozens Hardy, L.J. put the principle succinctly in the following words;\n\".I desire expressly to limit my judgment to a case in which the [party in contempt] is saying that the order complained of is outside the jurisdiction of the court, as distinguished from the case of an order which, although it is within the jurisdiction of the court, ought not, it is said, to have been made.\"\nLord Denning made the following pertinent observations in Hadkinson;\n\"It is a strong thing for a court to refuse to hear a party to a cause and it is only to be justified by grave considerations of public policy. It is step which a court will only take when the contempt itself impedes the course of justice and there is no other effective means of securing his compliance.\"\n34.  There is still one more reason why the appellant-Company should be denied equitable relief under Article 136 of the Constitution. According the respondent-Bank, the appellant has not come with clean hands before the Bank. It has suppressed and concealed material facts from the Court.\n35.  It is not in dispute that when the loan was taken by the appellant-Company from the respondent- Bank, certain immovable properties including residential premises of the Director of the Company had been mortgaged with the Bank and a document to that effect had been executed in favour of the Bank. The owner/Director Sudha Goel had filed an affidavit dated February 16, 1996. In the said affidavit, it was, inter alia, stated as under:\n\"That I/We declare and say that I/We have not created any mortgage charge, or encumbrance of any kind or nature whatsoever on or in respect of the said property. I/We further declare and say that the said property is free from all encumbrances, claims or demands of any kind or nature whatsoever.\nI/We shall not sell, charge, encumbrance, lease, dispose off or deal with any of my/our property in any manner whatsoever until such time all the liabilities under the various facilities granted to M/s. Prestige Lights Ltd. has been paid in full by the said M/s. Prestige Lights Ltd. and the deponent has got the discharge confirmed in writing\".\n36.  In spite of the above declaration, undertaking and affidavit, encumbrance has been created by the deponent and the Company over the property in respect of which such undertaking has been furnished.\n37.  It was also alleged by the respondent-Bank that the appellant-Company had shifted machinery to other place and stock statements were not supplied to the respondent-Bank. On August 4, 2004, the Central Excise and Custom Officials attached the Plant and Machinery of the Company for recovery of its dues. On August 25, 2004, Uttar Pradesh Financial Corporation issued a notice under Section 29 of the State Financial Corporation Act, 1951 for taking over physical possession of the assets of the appellant-Company. On May 16, 2005 a collusive suit was got filed by one Yashpal in Haridwar Court wherein the plaintiff had asserted that he was the tenant of Sudha Goel in respect of mortgaged property in question and he should not be dispossessed. A summons of the said suit was issued to the respondent-Bank. On May 24, 2005, the respondent-Bank received another summons from a Court that one Vijendra Singh Tyagi claimed himself to be the tenant of the aforesaid mortgaged premises.\n38.  It is thus clear that though the appellant- Company had approached the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution, it had not candidly stated all the facts to the Court. The High Court is exercising discretionary and extraordinary jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution. Over and above, a Court of Law is also a Court of Equity. It is, therefore, of utmost necessity that when a party approaches a High Court, he must place all the facts before the Court without any reservation. If there is suppression of material facts on the part of the applicant or twisted facts have been placed before the Court, the Writ Court may refuse to entertain the petition and dismiss it without entering into merits of the matter.\n39.  The object underlying the above principle has been succinctly stated by Scrutton, L.J., in R v. Kensington Income Tax Commissioners, [(1917) 1 KB 486 : 86 LJ KB 257 : 116 LT 136], in the following words:\n\"It has been for many years the rule of the Court, and one which it is of the greatest importance to maintain, that when an applicant comes to the Court to obtain relief on an ex parte statement he should made a full and fair disclosure of all the material facts facts, not law. He must not misstate the law if he can help it the Court is supposed to know the law. But it knows nothing about the facts, and the applicant must state fully and fairly the facts, and the penalty by which the Court enforces that obligation is that if it finds out that the facts have not been fully and fairly stated to it, the Court will set aside, any action which it has taken on the faith of the imperfect statement\"\n40.  It is well settled that a prerogative remedy is not a matter of course. In exercising extraordinary power, therefore, a Writ Court will indeed bear in mind the conduct of the party who is invoking such jurisdiction. If the applicant does not disclose full facts or suppresses relevant materials or is otherwise guilty of misleading the Court, the Court may dismiss the Action without adjudicating the matter. The rule has been evolved in larger public interest to deter unscrupulous litigants from abusing the process of Court by deceiving it. The very basis of the writ jurisdiction rests in disclosure of true, complete and correct facts. If the material facts are not candidly stated or are suppressed or are distorted, the very functioning of the writ courts would become impossible.\n41.  In the case on hand, several facts had been suppressed by the appellant-Company. Collusive action has been taken with a view to deprive the respondent- Bank from realizing legal and legitimate dues to which it was otherwise entitled. The Company had never disclosed that it had created third party's interests in the property mortgaged with the Bank. It had also shifted machinery and materials without informing the respondent-Bank prejudicially affecting the interest of the Bank. It has created tenancy or third party's right over the property mortgaged with the Bank. All these allegations are relevant when such petitioner comes before the Court and prays for discretionary and equitable relief. In our judgment, the submission of the respondent-Bank is well-founded that appellant is not entitled to ask for an extraordinary remedy under Article 226 of the Constitution from the High Court as also equitable remedy from this Court under Article 136 of the Constitution. A party, whose hands are soiled, cannot hold the writ of the Court. We, therefore, hold that the High Court was not in error in refusing relief to the appellant-Company.\n42.  For the foregoing reasons, we hold that by dismissing the petition in limine, the High Court has neither committed an error of law nor of jurisdiction.\n43. The appellant Company is not entitled to any relief. Though the respondent-Bank is right in submitting that the appellant has suppressed material facts from this Court as also that it has not complied with interim order passed by the Court and it has, therefore, no right to claim hearing on merits, we have considered the merits of the matter also and we are of the considered view that no case has been made out for interference with the Action taken by the respondent-Bank or the order passed by the High Court.\n44.  The appeal, therefore, deserves to be dismissed and is accordingly dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed\n"}, {"document_id": 3, "content": "Madhya Pradesh State Cooperative Bank Limited, Bhopal v Nanuram Yadav And Ors\nSupreme Court of India\n\n25 September 2007\nCIVIL APPEAL NO. 4481 OF 2007 (Arising out of SLP (C) No. 12236 OF 2006) WITH CIVIL APPEAL NO. 4483 OF 2007 (Arising out of SLP (C) NO. 19499 OF 2006) AND CIVIL APPEAL NO. 4482 OF 2007 (Arising out of SLP (C) NO. 3979 OF 2007)\nThe Judgment was delivered by : P. Sathasivam, J.\nLeave granted in all the special leave petitions.\n1.  How public appointments to be made, whether Lokayukt constituted under the M.P. Lokayukt Evam Up-Lokayukt Adhiniyam, 1981 has jurisdiction to go into the appointment of employees of the M.P. State Cooperative Bank and whether 60 clerks-cum-typists appointed by the said Bank were in accordance with the service rules are the questions to be decided in these appeals\n2.  The Madhya Pradesh State Cooperative Bank Ltd., through its Managing Director challenges the order dated 19.04.2006 passed by the Division Bench of High Court of Madhya Pradesh at Jabalpur in Writ Petition No. 1421 of 2005, by way of Special Leave Petition No. 12236 of 2006 before this Court. Questioning the very same order, some of the writ petitioners, numbering 26, who earlier approached the High Court, filed Special Leave Petition No. 19499 of 2006 before this Court. The other writ petitioners, numbering 27, who also agitated the matter before the High Court questioning certain directions filed another special leave petition No. 3979 of 2007 before this Court. Inasmuch as the issues raised and challenge in all these petitions relate to the very same order of the High Court and are interconnected, they are being disposed of by the following common judgment.\n3.  The brief facts, in nutshell, are as follows: On 24.06.1994, the Managing Director of the M.P. State Cooperative Bank Ltd., (hereinafter referred to as 'the Bank') requested the Cooperative Commissioner and Registrar of the Cooperative Societies, M.P., Bhopal for appointment of 60 ad- hoc clerks-cum-typists in the Bank. By letter dated 29.06.1994, conditional sanction was granted for appointment of 40 clerks-cum-typists on ad-hoc basis for 6 months mentioning that in the meantime the Bank has to take steps to fill up the vacant posts by issuing advertisement and comply the Rules keeping in view the reservation under the Government Rules. Again, by letter dated 25.10.1994, the Managing Director of the Bank requested for sanctioning the appointment of another 20 clerks-cum-typists on ad-hoc basis. By letter dated 11.11.1994, the Cooperative Commissioner and Registrar sanctioned the appointment of another 20 clerks-cum-typists on ad-hoc basis for 6 months on the condition as mentioned in the earlier letter dated 29.06.1994.\n4.  Pursuant to the aforesaid sanction letters, on 31.01.1995, the Bank appointed 60 clerks-cum-typists on ad- hoc basis for a period of six months. After appointment, two employees left the services of the Bank.\n5.  After expiry of six months, as envisaged under Rule 22(a) of the Staff Service Rules, 1976, all the appointed persons (writ petitioners before the High Court) were required to appear in the written examination so that they could be appointed for a period of one year as probationers. All of them took the written examination and became successful. Those persons were required by the Bank to appear for an interview on 21.07.1995 before the Selection Committee. The Selection Committee, after satisfying itself, recommended their names for appointment on regular basis. All the appointed persons were asked by the Bank to furnish service-cum-security Bond for a period of three years with a deposit of Rs.5,000/- as security in the form of FDRs. All the appointees complied with the said condition. While they are discharging their duties, taking into consideration of their performance etc., the appointing authority, under Rule 14(b), confirmed their services on the post of clerks-cum-typists on 30.10.1996.\n6. When the matter stood thus, according to the writ petitioners, all of a sudden, without any notice or assigning any reason, the Managing Director of the Bank issued termination order under Rule 61 of the Rules on 27.10.1997. Aggrieved by those orders, the affected persons approached the High Court. It is also the claim of the affected persons that after getting the order of termination they came to know that the termination order was issued by the Bank on the basis of the direction dated 01.08.1997 issued by the Commissioner Cooperatives- cum-Registrar to the Managing Director of the Bank on the foundation that the Lokayukt had found 58 clerks-cum-typists had been illegally appointed on the post, hence it was imperative to terminate their services taking aid of Rule 61 of the Staff Service Rules.\n7.  The Division Bench of the High Court, by impugned order, while allowing the writ petition, came to the following conclusion:-\n\"i. The Rule 61 of the Staff Selection Rules is ultra- vires and unconstitutional.\nii. The order dated 04.02.2005 passed by the Tribunal vide Annexure.P4 is quashed.\niii. The issue as to the status earned by the writ petitioners is remanded to the M.P. Cooperative Tribunal for adjudication.\niv. The M.P. Cooperative Tribunal shall finalise the lis within a period of four months from the date of order.\"\n8. Questioning the above-said conclusions/directions, as stated earlier, the Bank as well as their employees/writ petitioners filed the above appeals.\n9.  We heard Mr. S.K. Gambhir and Mr. S.K. Dubey, learned senior counsel and Mr. Krishna Mohan Shukla, learned counsel for the appellant and Mr. B.S. Banthia and Mr. Ramesh Babu M.R., learned counsel for the respondents.\n10.  Mr. S.K. Gambhir, learned senior counsel, appearing for the Bank, raised the following contentions:\n(i) The appointment of 58 employees is not only contrary to the directions of the Commissioner Cooperative and Registrar, Cooperative Societies dated 29.6.1994 for holding regular appointments after advertisement etc. but also contrary to Rule 21 of the Rules;\n(ii) The process adopted was a farce as only these candidates were put to written test and interview in which none of them was unsuccessful. The selection itself was a result of favourtism and nepotism and contrary to the provisions of Arts. 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India;\n(iii) When the initial appointment itself was illegal and void ab initio, such appointments could not be made regular and there was no question to determine their status;\n(iv) Lokayukt, who has jurisdiction upon enquiry, found that all the appointments were farce, pre-planned and intended to help the favoured persons. Since the said report has not been set aside, the recommendation of the Lokayukt is binding on the Government;\n(v) The validity of Rule 61 was not called for because the employees were not entitled to any notice and their services deserve to be dispensed with straightaway.\n11.  Mr. S.K. Dubey, learned senior counsel and Mr. Krishna Mohan Shukla, learned counsel, appearing for the employees, raised the following contentions:\n(i) The High Court having found Rule 61 invalid, there is no need to remit the matter to the Tribunal to find out the status of employees;\n(ii) Lokayukt has no jurisdiction to go into the appointment of these employees;\n(iii) Inasmuch as the employees concerned were subjected to written test, interview, executed security bond, successful in their probation period, satisfied Staff Service Rules, the order of the Managing Director terminating their services without notice and enquiry merely based on the direction of the Registrar of the Cooperative Societies, cannot be sustained;\n(iv) In any event, the Registrar is obliged to examine the report of the Lokayukt before accepting the recommendations made therein;\nWe have considered the rival contentions and the relevant materials.\n12.  Before analyzing the claim of both the parties, it is useful to refer to relevant provisions of the Staff Service Rules of Madhya Pradesh Rajya Sahakari Bank Maryadit which were approved by the Registrar, Co-operative Societies, M.P. Bhopal and made applicable with effect from 19th November, 1976. Chapter-3 deals with 'Classification of Employees'. Rule 3 (b) defines \"Permanent Employees\" which reads as follows: \"3(b) A \"Permanent Employee\" means an employee who has been appointed as permanent employee or who has been confirmed on a vacant permanent post as such.\"\n13.  Chapter-6 deals with selection of personnel in the Bank. Rules 21 and 22(a), which are relevant, read as follows:\n\"21. All vacancies falling within the purview of the employment exchange (Notification of vacancies) Act, 1959 shall be duly notified to the employment exchange concerned. The post/posts may also be advertised in the local or All India Newspapers at the option of the appointing authority. The advertisement should give scales of pay, dearness allowance, the essential and preferential qualifications, age limit etc.\"\n\" 22(a) Candidates for the posts in Grade Vth and such other posts shall have to undergo a written test in the manner prescribed by the 'Staff Committee'. Candidates passing at such test shall be eligible for appointment only after the selection at personal interview by the 'Selection Committee' consisting of Chairman of the Bank or his nominee Director, Registrar, Cooperative Societies M.P. or his nominee not below the rank of Joint Registrar, Cooperative Societies, M.P. & Managing Director of the Bank for deciding the selection of employees.\nProvided further that for the selection of technical staff Chief Engineer of the Bank shall additional member of the committee. It is also provided that when elected board ceases to function, by any reason, Chairman of the Bank shall be replaced by the Officer-In-Charge of the Bank remaining members of the 'Selection Committee' will remain the same. The meeting of 'Selection Committee' will be presided by the Chairman of the Bank/Officer-In-Charge of the Bank as the case may be. Presence of all the members of the committee shall be necessary for the meeting.\"\n14.  As per Rule 23(a)(iv), employees in Grade III, IV and V, the Selection Authority is Selection Committee and the Appointing Authority is Managing Director/General Manager/Deputy General Manager or any person authorized by the Managing Director. Rule 23(c) makes it clear that appointment made to fill a vacancy of a permanent post shall be made on probation unless otherwise specifically mentioned in the order of appointment given to the employee.\n15.  Under Section 55(1) of the Madhya Pradesh Cooperative Societies Act, 1960 (hereinafter referred to as \"the Act\"), the Registrar of Cooperative Society has been given power to frame Service Rules of the employees working under different cooperative institutions and in furtherance of the powers given under the aforesaid provision, the Registrar has framed the service conditions for the employees of the appellant-Bank, which are called Madhya Pradesh Rajya Sahakari Bank Employees (Terms of Employment and Working Conditions) Rules, 1976. It is also brought to our notice that these Staff Service Rules have since been amended from time to time. We have already referred to the Rules which are applicable to the issues raised in these appeals.\n16.  Mr. S.K. Gambhir, learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant-Bank, by drawing our attention to the principles laid down by this Court in various decisions in respect to public appointments, submitted that inasmuch as the entire procedure and the selection made are contrary to the Rules, first those persons are not entitled to any notice in compliance with principles of natural justice and secondly all of them are liable to be sent out without further enquiry. In support of his submission, he relied on the decision of this Court in Krishan Yadav & Anr. Vs. State of Haryana & Ors., (1994) 4 SCC 165 1994 Indlaw SC 220. While considering fraud, nepotism, favouritism and arbitrariness in public appointments, this Court, in paragraphs 19 and 20 of the judgment, laid down the following principles which read as under:\n\"19. It is highly regrettable that the holders of public offices both big and small have forgotten that the offices entrusted to them are sacred trusts. Such offices are meant for use and not abuse. From a Minister to a menial everyone has been dishonest to gain undue advantages. The whole examination and the interview have turned out to be farcical exhibiting base character of those who have been responsible for this sordid episode. It shocks our conscience to come across such a systematic fraud. It is somewhat surprising the High Court should have taken the path of least resistance stating in view of the destruction of records, that it was helpless. It should have helped itself. Law is not that powerless.\n20. In the above circumstances, what are we to do? The only proper course open to us is to set aside the entire selection. The plea was made that innocent candidates should not be penalised for the misdeeds of others. We are unable to accept this argument. When the entire selection is stinking, conceived in fraud and delivered in deceit, individual innocence has no place as \"Fraud unravels everything\". To put it in other words, the entire selection is arbitrary. It is that which is faulted and not the individual candidates. Accordingly we hereby set aside the selection of Taxation Inspectors.\"\n17.  In the case of Union of India & Ors. Vs. O. Chakradhar, (2002) 3 SCC 146 2002 Indlaw SC 1200, this Court following the law laid down in Krishan Yadav's case 1994 Indlaw SC 220 (supra), upheld the Railway Board's decision to cancel the selection on the ground of fraud committed by the Selection Authorities. This Court, in paragraph 12 of the judgment, concluded as under:\n\"12. As per the report of the CBI whole selection smacks of mala fides and arbitrariness. All norms are said to have been violated with impunity at each stage viz. right from the stage of entertaining applications, with answer-sheets while in the custody of Chairman, in holding typing test, in interview and in the end while preparing the final result. In such circumstances it may not be possible to pick out or choose any few persons in respect of whom alone the selection could be cancelled and their services in pursuance thereof could be terminated. The illegality and irregularity are so inter-mixed with the whole process of the selection that it becomes impossible to sort out the right from the wrong or vice versa. The result of such a selection cannot be relied or acted upon. It is not a case where a question of misconduct on the part of a candidate is to be gone into but a case where those who conducted the selection have rendered it wholly unacceptable. Guilt of those who have been selected is not the question under consideration but the question is could such selection be acted upon in the matter of public employment? We are therefore of the view that it is not one of those cases where it may have been possible to issue any individual notice of misconduct to each selectee and seek his explanation in regard to the large scale widespread and all pervasive illegalities and irregularities committed by those who conducted the selection which may of course possibly be for the benefit of those who have been selected but there may be a few who may have deserved selection otherwise but it is difficult to separate the cases of some of the candidates from the rest even if there may be some. The decision in the case of Krishan Yadav 1994 Indlaw SC 220 (supra) applies to the facts of the present case. The Railway Board's decision to cancel the selection cannot be faulted with. The appeal therefore deserves to be allowed.\"\n18.  In the case of A. Umarani vs. Registrar, Cooperative Societies & Ors., (2004) 7 SCC 112 2004 Indlaw SC 606, this Court has reiterated the principles to be followed in the matter of public employment. In that case, in the State of Tamil Nadu, a large number of employees of Cooperative Societies were appointed without notifying the vacancies to the employment exchange and without following the other mandatory provisions of the Act and the Rules framed thereunder relevant to recruitment. A large number of appointees furthermore did not have the requisite educational qualification or other qualification like cooperative training, etc. The reservation policy of the State was not followed by the cooperative societies.\n19. The recruitments were made beyond the permissible cadre strength. With a view to condone the serious lapses on the part of the cooperative societies in making such appointments in illegal and arbitrary manner, the State Government issued various orders from time to time, in terms whereof such appointments were sought to be regularized fixing a cut-off date therefor. Latest order was G.O. Ms. No. 86 dated 12.3.2001 by which the cut-off date was extended up to 11.3.2001 and which sought to regularize appointments made after 8.7.1980 without notifying the employment exchange in respect of those employees who had completed 480 days of service in two years, purported to be in terms of the T.N. Industrial Establishments (Conferment of Permanent Status to Workmen) Act, 1981. The legality and validity of the said Government order was challenged before the High Court.\n20. The High Court, inter alia, held that the said order shall not operate for regularization of any employee recruited by the cooperative societies in violation of sub-rule (1) of Rule 149 of the T.N. Cooperative Societies Rules, 1988, as amended by G.O. Ms. No. 212 dated 4.7.1995. The primal question for consideration in that appeals before this Court was whether the State had the requisite authority to direct regularization of services of the employees of the cooperative societies by reason of the impugned order. While dismissing the appeals, this Court, in paragraphs 39, 40, 41, 45, 68 and 69, held as under:\n\"39. Regularisation, in our considered opinion, is not and cannot be the mode of recruitment by any \"State\" within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution of India or any body or authority governed by a Statutory Act or the Rules framed thereunder. It is also now well-settled that an appointment made in violation of the mandatory provisions of the Statute and in particular ignoring the minimum educational qualification and other essential qualification would be wholly illegal. Such illegality cannot be cured by taking recourse to regularisation. (See State of H.P. v. Suresh Kumar Verma and Anr., (1996)7 SCC 562 1996 Indlaw SC 3143).\n40. It is equally well-settled that those who come by backdoor should go through that door. (See State of U.P. and Ors. v. U.P. State Law Officers Association & Ors.,(1994) 2 SCC 204 1994 Indlaw SC 1289).\n41. Regularisation furthermore cannot give permanence to an employee whose services are ad-hoc in nature.\n45. No regularisation is, thus, permissible in exercise of the statutory power conferred under Article 162 of the Constitution if the appointments have been made in contravention of the statutory Rules. 68. In a case of this nature this court should not even exercise its jurisdiction under Article 142 of the Constitution of India on misplaced sympathy.\n69. In Teri Oat Estates (P) Ltd. v. U.T., Chandigarh and Ors.(2004) 2 SCC 130 2003 Indlaw SC 1504, it is stated:\nWe have no doubt in our mind that sympathy or sentiment by itself cannot be a ground for passing an order in relation whereto the appellants miserably fail to establish a legal right. It is further trite that despite an extra-ordinary constitutional jurisdiction contained in Article 142 of the Constitution of India, this Court ordinarily would not pass an order, which would be in contravention of a statutory provision.\"\n21.  In the case of Indian Drugs & Pharmaceuticals Ltd. vs. Workmen, Indian Drugs & Pharmaceuticals Ltd., (2007) 1 SCC 408 2006 Indlaw SC 769, after referring the decision in Uma Devi's case (supra) and other decisions, this Court observed that the appointments made without following the appropriate procedure under the Rules/Government Circulars and without advertisement or inviting application from the open market was held to be in fragrant breach of Arts. 14 & 16 of the Constitution of India. It was further held that the Rules of recruitment cannot be relaxed and the Court/Tribunal cannot direct regularization of temporary appointees de hors the Rules, nor can it direct continuation of service of a temporary employee (whether called a casual, ad hoc or daily-rated employee) or payment of regular salaries to them.\n22.  It is clear that in the matter of public appointments, the following principles are to be followed:\n1) The appointments made without following the appropriate procedure under the Rules/Government Circulars and without advertisement or inviting applications from the open market would amount to breach of Arts. 14 & 16 of the Constitution of India.\n2) Regularisation cannot be a mode of appointment.\n3) An appointment made in violation of the mandatory provisions of the statute and in particular, ignoring the minimum educational qualification and other essential qualification would be wholly illegal. Such illegality cannot be cured by taking recourse to regularization.\n4) Those who come by back door should go through that door.\n5) No regularization is permissible in exercise of the statutory power conferred under Art. 162 of the Constitution of India if the appointments have been made in contravention of the statutory Rules.\n6) The Court should not exercise its jurisdiction on misplaced sympathy.\n7) If the mischief played so widespread and all pervasive, affecting the result, so as to make it difficult to pick out the persons who have been unlawfully benefited or wrongfully deprived of their selection, it will neither be possible nor necessary to issue individual show-cause notice to each selectee. The only way out would be to cancel the whole selection.\n8) When the entire selection is stinking, conceived in fraud and delivered in deceit, individual innocence has no place and the entire selection has to be set aside.\n23.  Keeping in mind the abovementioned principles, we have to consider whether the appointments were made in accordance with the Rules by following the procedure? If our answer is in the affirmative, all appointments have to be upheld and the orders terminating their services are to be quashed.\n24.  By letter dated 24.6.1994 (Annexure P-1), Mr. Balram Prasad Sharma, Managing Director of the Bank requested the Cooperative Commissioner and Registrar, Cooperative Societies, M.P. that against 100 vacant posts of Clerks-cum- Typist, at least 60 posts should be filled up from ad hoc appointment of eligible persons so that work of the Bank may be executed efficiently. Pursuant to the said request, Mr. R.N. Sharda, Additional Registrar, by his reply dated 29.6.1994 (Annexure P-2), after considering the request of the Managing Director of the Bank permitted to appoint 40 persons on ad hoc basis for six months. In the same proceedings, the Additional Registrar reiterated that the posts should be filled up within six months after issuing legal advertisement and according to Rules and keeping in view the reservation under Government Rules.\n25.  By letter dated 11.11.1994 (Annexure P-3), the Joint Registrar accorded permission to fill up 20 more posts for six months on ad hoc basis under prescribed qualifications.\n26.  Annexures P-1, P-2 and P-3 make it clear that based on the large number of vacancies in the post of Clerk-cum-Typist, and on the request of the Managing Director of the Bank, the Registrar who is empowered to sanction, permitted the Bank to fill up 60 vacant posts by following the procedure.\n27.  Mr. Gambhir, learned senior counsel, submitted that it was the complaint of the Bank that all the above-mentioned vacant posts were filled up without following the procedure prescribed in Rules 21,22,23 of the Rules. In other words, according to the Bank, without proper intimation to the employment exchange and advertisement in the newspapers mentioning all the details and without following the rule of reservation, these persons were appointed and subsequently regularized in the cadre of service. Rule 21 which we have already extracted in the paragraphs (supra) makes it clear that the vacancies should be notified to the employment exchange.\n28. In other words, intimation to the employment exchange and calling for a list of candidates is a mandatory one. On the other hand, the above Rule makes it clear that advertisement in the local or all India newspapers is at the option of the appointing authority. To put it clear, if there is proper intimation to the employment exchange regarding the vacancy and a request for eligible candidates, that would satisfy Rule 21. It is the specific case of the Bank that the said Rule was not fully complied with. In support of his submission, learned senior counsel appearing for the Bank, heavily relied on the report of Lokayukta. We shall deal with the complaint, enquiry and ultimate decision by the Lokayukt in the later paragraphs.\n29.  Insofar as the compliance of the Rules is concerned, learned counsel appearing for the employees, by drawing our attention to the statement made by the officers of the Bank before the Additional Registrar, contended that there was no violation of any of the Rules. One Mr. S.Kumar, former General Manager of the Bank was examined as witness No.2 before the Additional Registrar wherein he specifically deposed to the effect that all qualified applicants were invited as per the service rules, have to undergo written examination and who found successful were required to face interview by the Selection Committee of the Bank based on the report of the Selection Committee. According to him, those persons were appointed by the competent authority under the service Rules. In respect of a specific question, namely, whether the Bank had written a letter to the employment exchange for the names to be sent for the vacant posts, he answered \"yes, the letter was sent two months before\". When he was asked whether any list was received from the employment exchange, he answered \"No\". In respect of another question whether the Bank had given advertisement prior to the regular appointment, he answered \"No, because as per the Rules, it was necessary to write to the employment exchange and that was done\". When he was confronted with the letter dated 27.04.1996 of the employment exchange wherein it is stated that no such letter calling for a list was ever received, he emphatically denied and asserted that \"false entry is not done by the Bank\". After verifying the records, he concluded that all those persons who possess the necessary qualifications as per the service Rules of the Bank alone were given appointments after completing the formalities in accordance with the Rules.\n30.  One Mr. A.K.Parsi, then Assistant Manager (Admn.) in the Bank deposed before the same authority that from the year 1995, the writ petitioners were working with the Bank. According to him, initially they were appointed on ad-hoc basis in the post of clerk-cum-typist, thereafter, in the month of July, 1995, the employment exchange was informed and they were appointed on a regular pay-scale. In the cross- examination, after explaining the procedures to be followed, he asserted that in the case of the petitioners also those procedures were adopted and prior notice was published.\n31. He further reiterated that all the candidates who were successful in the interview were appointed and only then the Selection Committee selected those persons and all the selected candidates were kept under probation for a period of one year. He also informed before the Addl. Registrar that all the successful candidates who completed their probation period were asked to execute a bond. He highlighted that as per the bond, the appointees are to serve the Bank at least for three years and in fact deposited Rs.5,000/- as security. He also highlighted that though some of the selectees sought permission to pursue higher studies but permission was not granted due to the undertaking given by them by way of executing a security bond.\n32.  The above-mentioned statement of General Manager and Assistant Manager (Admn.) of the Bank cannot be lightly ignored. If we consider the correspondence between the Bank and the Registrar in respect of large number of vacancies, permission by the Registrar, who is none else than the competent authority, coupled with assertion of two responsible officers, it cannot be said that the procedures have not been strictly followed. No doubt, the employment exchange had intimated Lokayukt that there was no such information/request from the Bank, however, the fact remains that there was no such communication to the Registrar and under what circumstance, the same was intimated to the Lokayukt. The above-mentioned particulars show that procedures have been complied with before selecting those persons in the vacant posts.\n33. The private respondents/writ petitioners demonstrated that taking note of large number of vacancies in the post of clerk-cum-typist and urgency in filling up the same due to administrative reasons, after getting proper sanction from the competent authority i.e. Registrar, intimating the same to the employment exchange, they were initially appointed for a period of six months on ad-hoc basis and thereafter by conducting written examination followed by interview, they were selected. It is also brought to our notice that after completion of probationary period of one year, these persons were posted in the regular cadre. Though few selectees were related to the then Managing Director of the Bank, on this ground alone, their appointments cannot be interfered with. The High Court has lost sight of relevant material aspects and confirmed the order of termination mainly based on the report of the Lokayukt.\n34.  Now, let us consider complaints, proceedings and the ultimate decision/recommendation of Lokayukt. The Government of Madhya Pradesh in order to make provision for the appointment and functions of certain authorities for the enquiry in the allegations against public servants and for matters connected therewith, enacted the M.P. Lokayukt Evam Up-Lokayukt Adhiniyam, 1981. As per definition 2(f) Lokayukt means a person appointed as the Lokayukt under Section 3. Public servant as defined in Section 2(g) reads thus:\n\"2. (g) \"Public servant\" means person falling under any of the following categories, namely,-\n(i) Minister;\n(ii) a person having the rank of a Minister but shall not include Speaker and Deputy Speaker of the Madhya Pradesh Vidhan Sabha and Neta Pratipaksha;\n(iii) an officer referred to in clause (a);\n(iv) an officer of an Apex Society or Central Society within the meaning of clause (t-1) read with clauses (a-1), (c-1) and (z) of Section 2 of the Madhya Pradesh Co-operative Societies Act, 1960 (No. 17 of 1961);\n(v) Any person holding any office in, or an employee of-\n(i) a Government company within the meaning of Section 617 of the Companies Act, 1956; or (ii) a Corporation or local authority established by State\nGovernment under a Central or State enactment.\n(vi) xxx xxx xxxx\"\n35. Sections 7 and 8 speak about matters which may be enquired into by Lokayukt or Up-Lokayukt and matters not to be enquired by the said authorities. Section 10 makes it clear that both Lokayukt or Up-Lokayukt in each case before it, decide the procedure to be followed for making the enquiry and in so doing ensure that the principles of natural justice are satisfied. Section 12 mandates that after enquiry into the allegations, the Lokayukt or Up-Lokayukt is satisfied that such allegation is established, submit a report in writing, communicate his findings and recommendations along with the relevant documents, materials and other evidence to the competent authority.\n36. Though detailed arguments were advanced pointing out that Lokayukt was not competent to go into the appointments that were made, in view of Section 2(g)(iv), we are of the view that officers of the apex society or central society under M.P. Cooperative Societies Act are amenable and there is no need to elaborate the said aspect in this matter since we are concerned about the validity or otherwise of the appointment of the employees in the Bank. It is seen from the materials that after the appointments of the aforesaid 58 employees, a complaint was lodged with Lokayukt by one Shri N.K. Saxena and the said complaint was investigated by the Lokayukt.\n37. Though it is stated that the Lokayukt afforded an opportunity of hearing to the Chairman of the petitioner Bank as well as officials of the Bank and Cooperative Department, admittedly the employees were not afforded notice or opportunity of being heard in the enquiry by the Lokayukt. It is not in dispute that on receipt of the report of Lokayukt, the competent authority forwarded the same to the Registrar of Cooperative Societies who, in turn, without taking a decision or an order by following the service rules or any of the provisions of the M.P. Cooperative Societies Act mechanically directed the Managing Director of the Bank to terminate all the appointees. We are of the view particularly, as observed earlier, though the officers of the apex society under M.P. Cooperative Societies Act are amenable to the jurisdiction of the Lokayukt, the persons concerned who are lower-grade employees i.e. clerks-cum-typists cannot be terminated without following the service rules applicable to them. It is not in dispute that elaborate procedures are to be followed before terminating the service of an employee under the provisions of the M.P. Cooperative Societies Act and the service rules made thereunder.\n38. In those circumstances, in the absence of opportunity to the employees, the termination order which was sent at the instance of Commissioner, Cooperative Societies based on the report of Lokayukt cannot be sustained.\n39.  In the light of the factual details, while reiterating the above-mentioned principles in the matter of public appointment, we are of the considered view that the authorities were not justified in terminating the services of these workmen. In view of our conclusion, it is unnecessary to go into the correctness or otherwise of Rule 61 of the Rules and the said issue is left open. We are also of the view and as rightly pointed out by counsel appearing for the employees that there is no need to remit the matter to the Registrar or any other authority for determination of their status. The said direction of the High Court is also liable to be set aside.\n40.  In the light of the above discussion, we pass the following order:-\ni) The conclusion with regard to Rule 61 of the Staff Selection Rules is not warranted and the issue is left open;\nii) The decision of the Bank as well as Registrar of the Cooperative Societies terminating the services of the employees based on the report of the Lokayukt cannot be sustained and the same is liable to be set aside.\niii) In view of our above conclusion, there is no need to remand the issue to the Registrar or any other authority for adjudication with regard to the status earned by these employees, consequently the said direction of the High Court is also set aside.\n41.  In the result, Civil Appeal No. 4481 of 2007 arising out of SLP (C) No. 12236 of 2006 filed by the Bank is disposed of on the above terms. Civil Appeal No. 4483 of 2007 arising out of SLP (C) No. 19499 of 2006 and Civil Appeal No. 4482 of 2007 arising out of SLP (C) No. 3979 of 2007 filed by the employees are allowed. However, there shall be no order as to costs.\nAppeal allowed\n"}, {"document_id": 4, "content": "Allahabad High School Society,Allahabad & Another v State Of U.P.\nSupreme Court of India\n\n12  May  2011\nCivil Appeal No. 4329 of 2011(Arising Out of Special Leave Petition (C) No. 9353 of 2011)\nThe Judgment was delivered by : P.

This appeal is directed against the judgment and final order dated 25.03.2011 passed by the Division Bench of the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad in Special Appeal No. 281 of 2011 whereby the Division Bench confirmed the order dated 22.02.2011 passed by the learned Single Judge and the order dated 24.07.2010 passed by the Assistant Registrar, Firms, Societies & Chits, Allahabad, who cancelled the proceedings related to amendments registered on 30.05.2007.\n4.   Brief facts:\n(a) The appellant-Allahabad High School Society (hereinafter referred to as \"the Society\") was established in the year 1861 and was registered on 09.02.1888 under the U.P. Societies Registration Act, 1860 (hereinafter referred to as \"the Act\"). According to the Constitution of the Society, it was established and registered with the object to advance the cause of Christian education in Allahabad, according to the teaching of the Church of England as by law established, especially amongst the children of the European and Anglo-Indian population, in conformity with, and agreeably to, the provisions of the Rules of the Allahabad High Schools Society, 1952 (in short 'the Rules'). The memorandum of the Society contains various clauses which includes that the Society shall consist of the Bishop of Lucknow and of other Members not exceeding 23, three of whom shall be respectively the Senior Chaplain for the time being of the Church of England at Allahabad, the Commissioner for the time being of the Allahabad Division and the Collector for the time being of the Allahabad District. The affairs of the Society shall be managed by all the Members of the Society that the Bishop of Lucknow, the Honorary Secretary and the Honorary Treasurer of the Society, shall have the authority to execute all contracts and deeds on behalf of the Society. The management of the Girls' School shall be conducted by a Standing Committee of all the lady Members of the Society and the management of the Boys' School shall be conducted by a Standing Committee of all the men who are Members of the Society. These Schools shall be subject to the inspection of the Government and of the Diocesan Council and make such returns as may be required by the Diocesan Council from time to time.\n(b) On 28.05.2007, Rules, Constitution and Bye-laws of the Society, in question, were amended, which were registered on 30.05.2007 and the above-said information was also communicated to the Assistant Registrar, Firms, Societies & Chits, Allahabad. Since several objections were raised about the amendments made on 28.05.2007, the Assistant Registrar, who is the competent authority under the Act, after analyzing all the materials with reference to various clauses of memorandum, had concluded that the amendments were made arbitrarily, unlawfully and without following the democratic process, and in contravention of the provisions of the Act and the Rules and, therefore, by order dated 24.07.2010, cancelled the registration of the proceedings related to amendments registered on 30.05.2007, under Section 12D(b) of the Act, in pursuance of notice issued under Section 12D(1) of the Act. In the same order, the Assistant Registrar issued direction to the Bishop, Diocese of Lucknow, who is an ex-officio member of the Society and Chairman of the Governing Body under the Rules, to convene a General Body Meeting, after informing all the Members about the present situation and circumstances and reasons regarding amendments to the Rules to comply with Rule 11 of the 1952 Rules and to form a Governing Body and present the same.\n(c) The above order of the Assistant Registrar was challenged by the appellant-Society before the learned Single Judge of the High Court of Allahabad in Civil Misc. Writ Petition No. 46551 of 2010. The learned Single Judge, after going into the merits of the claim with reference to statutory provisions and all other relevant materials, vide his order dated 22.02.2011, confirmed the order passed by the Assistant Registrar and dismissed the writ petition filed by the Society.\n(d) Aggrieved by the order of the learned Single Judge, the Society filed Special Appeal No. 281 of 2011 before the Division Bench of the High Court assailing the correctness of the judgment and order dated 22.02.2011. The Division Bench, after considering the rival claims and taking note of the basic and core objects of the Society to impart Christian education in Allahabad and neighbouring areas, by judgment and order dated 25.03.2011, confirmed the orders passed by the learned Single Judge and the Assistant Registrar, consequently, dismissed the special appeal being devoid of any merits. The said order is under challenge in this appeal by way of special leave.\n5.   Heard Mr. C.S. Vaidyanathan, learned senior counsel for the appellant-Society, Mr. R. Venkataramani, learned senior counsel for respondent No.3 and Mr. T.P. Singh, learned senior counsel for the impleaded party.\n6.   In view of the various proceedings, orders by the authorities under the Act and the decision of the learned Single Judge, the Division Bench and this Court after taking note of the fact that the Assistant Registrar had issued a direction to the Chairman of the Governing Body to convene a fresh General Body Meeting after notifying all the Members about the present situation and circumstances and reasons as per the Rules and take a fresh decision regarding amendments to the Rules, we are of the view that it is not necessary to refer all those factual details and earlier orders.\n7.   The points for consideration in this appeal are whether the Assistant Registrar was justified in cancelling the amendments and permitting the Chairman, Governing Body, to convene fresh meeting and take a decision as per the Rules and whether the learned Single Judge and the Division Bench of the High Court have committed any error in confirming the said order?\n8.   It is not in dispute that the Assistant Registrar of the Society issued certain show cause notices to the appellants which were challenged by filing Civil Misc. Writ Petition No. 9598 of 2010. When notices dated 02.02.2010 and 11.02.2010 were issued to the Society, they filed the said writ petition praying for issuance of a writ in the nature of certiorari for quashing the same. The High Court, after finding that it would be appropriate to adjudicate the matter by the relevant authority on the basis of relevant records whether the amendments made in the bye-laws by the appellants were valid or not and whether the object of the Society meaning in the initial bye-laws has been changed or not or whether it is against public policy, all these have to be adjudicated on the basis of the show cause notices and it will be inappropriate to go into the correctness of the same at this stage, dismissed the writ petition vide order dated 16.04.2010 as not maintainable and directed the Registrar to decide the dispute between the parties after affording opportunity to the appellants as well as the respondents-objectors.\n9.  The appellants, not satisfied with the above order of the learned Single Judge, filed Special Appeal No. 615 of 2010 before the Division Bench which was dismissed on 20.05.2010 observing that there was a fraud, manipulation and documents have been forged.\n10.   The following discussion and conclusion of the Division Bench about Mr. C.V. Innis, functioning as Secretary of the Society are relevant:\n\"Mr. Cedric Valentine Innis, was born on 18.09.1948. He is a CNI CHRISTIAN (Anglo-Indian). He was appointed as Principal of the BHS on 12.01.1988 by the Chairman of the Society/The Bishop of Lucknow, Diocese of Lucknow, C.N.I. He took charge on 15.03.1988. He was confirmed after one year w.e.f. 15.03.1989. At the time of his appointment as Principal the age of superannuation of Principal BHS had already been enhanced from 58 years to 60 years. The age of superannuation was enhanced on the recommendation of Diocesan Education Board which had resolved on 10.01.1985 to fix the retirement age of the Principals of the English medium Schools, governed by the Anglo-Indian Education Code, of the Diocese of Lucknow to sixty years. The proviso permitted yearly extensions up to a maximum of five years. The Society in the Governing Body meeting held on 12.12.1985 accepted and adopted the Diocesan Education Board Resolution dated 10.01.1985.\nThe Predecessor of Mr. C.V. Innis, retired at the age of 60 years. The age of superannuation of the teaching staff was enhanced in the meeting dated 23.11.2006 from 58 years to 62 years. In the proceedings of the meeting dated 23.11.2006, it had not been mentioned as to whether the meeting was a Governing Body Meeting or an Annual General Meeting. There was no agenda for enhancing the age of superannuation. The proceedings of the meeting dated 23.11.2006 filed as Annexure SRA-II at Page 70 is a forged document as it mentions enhancement in age of superannuation of management staff and non-teaching staff whereas in the original proceedings of 23.11.2006 produced by the counsel for the appellant only the age of superannuation of the teaching staff had been enhanced. A question arises that what was the need for forgery for enhancing the age of superannuation. The answer appears to be simple. The appellants wanted to hide under the carpet that Principal's age of superannuation had already been enhanced by the Society on 12.12.1985 and they wanted to hide the control of Diocese of Lucknow.\nFrom the aforesaid discussion, it appears that the meeting dated 23.11.2006 was illegal being in violation of Rule 11 and in such a meeting age of superannuation could not be enhanced. The enhancement made in the meeting dated 23.11.2006 would not confer any right on Mr. C.V. Innis the Principal of BHS. His age of superannuation was 60 years and there being no material on record about any extension of service granted to him, it appears that he retired from the post of Principal of BHS in September, 2008.\"\n11.  Against the dismissal of the Special Appeal No. 615 of 2010, the Society approached this Court by way of special leave petition and the same was dismissed vide order dated 15.06.2010 with an observation that the Assistant Registrar is free to pass an order on merits including the question of jurisdiction in accordance with law.\n12.  With this background, we have to verify whether the order of the Assistant Registrar dated 24.07.2010 holding that all the proceedings were illegal/frivolous or not. The Assistant Registrar, in his order, has also held that the Members of the Society had died prior to 1997 and there was manipulation in the record. It is pertinent to refer the discussion and ultimate conclusion by the Assistant Registrar which reads as under:\n\"After going through the complaints pertaining to the amendment made by the Bishop and other people, evidence and documents presented as had been mentioned above, proceedings for brining fraudulent amendments are found to be contrary to the registered bye laws as well as directions given by the Assistant Registrar to comply with the provisions of the Societies Registration Act, 1860. In spite of several opportunities, the applicant has failed to prove the veracity and the genuineness of the proceedings. It is also obvious through the documents that neither list nor balance sheet has been produced regularly every year under Section 4(1) of the Act. From the documents produced, it is also clear that after complaints were made and information as sought regarding renewal, Shri C.V. Innes has sought to deposit the requisite fee under Section 3A(5) of the Act.\nIn the list relating to managing committee as submitted,15 lists have been submitted of members of the managing committee from the year 1977-78 to year 1997-98; in the said list 3 persons have been mentioned as occupying the post of Secretary; the reasons for the same are not clear. Along with the documents submitted, an affidavit of Shri C.V. Innes has also been submitted in which it is stated that all persons who were officers and members of the society prior to 1997 are dead.\nIn such a situation it is not clear how the identity of the society continued to exist. If all the members were dead then it is not clear how new members were elected and whether they were elected under rules or not.....\"\n13. Apart from this, the Assistant Registrar has also specifically concluded that the amendments to the proceedings were made arbitrarily, unlawfully and decisions were taken without following the democratic process and in contravention of the provisions of the Act and the Rules. After arriving at such factual conclusion based on appreciation of acceptable materials, the Assistant Registrar cancelled the registration of proceedings related to the amendments registered on 30.05.2007 under Section 12D(b) of the Act.\n14.  The said order of the Assistant Registrar dated 24.07.2010 was challenged in the writ petition which was dismissed by the learned Single Judge vide order dated 22.02.2011 pointing out that the alleged Secretary of the appellants Mr. Innis has no business to continue in the said post. It is apt and relevant to quote the following conclusion of the learned Single Judge which reads as under:\n\"Most surprising feature in the present case is that Secretary of the Society is no one else than the Principal of the institution himself. He has been nominated as Secretary by virtue of being ex-officio Member. In order to perpetuate himself in the society and in the institution being fully aware of the fact that he was going to attain the age of superannuation and his Secretaryship would also automatically come to an end, an attempt was made by him to get his age extended and on the strength of the same to continue as Secretary of the society.\nAfter attaining the age of superannuation, Principal of the institution is not at all entitled to continue as Secretary. Specific mention has been made that petitioner No. 2 was Secretary by virtue of being Principal, who happens to be ex-officio member, and once he attained the age of superannuation as Principal, then he could be elected as Secretary only when he was valid member of the society, but at no point of time he had ever been enrolled as valid member of the general body of the society. This specific statement of fact has not been disputed in the rejoinder affidavit. Once this is the factual situational in respect of status of petitioner No. 2 as Principal of the institution has already attained the age of superannuation and this fact has not been substantiated before this Court as to in what way and manner he had been enrolled as member of the general body of the society, then legitimately petitioner No. 2 has no grievance. The Bishop who had accepted the request to act as Chairman along with petitioner No. 2 has already washed his sin, by resigning and submitting letter on 29.07.2010, regretting therein his deeds. These averments have been mentioned in paragraph 4(d) of the counter affidavit and said specific averments have not at all been replied.\"\n15.  It was also highlighted and demonstrated that there was no quorum in the meeting held on 28.05.2007 in which amendments had been carried out. It is seen that four Officers and five members of the Society were present in the meeting. One ex-officio member and four members were absent. There were total 14 (fourteen) members of the Society. In the Special General Meeting held on 28.05.2007 only nine members were present. Three quarter member of 14 members would be 10.5 members. Therefore, according to Rule 38 of the Rules, at least 10 members were required to be present at the Special General Meeting held on 28.05.2007. In the absence of quorum laid down by Rule 38, neither the amendments could be passed in the Special General Meeting of the Society nor could the amendments made be registered by the Assistant Registrar. The above details, as noted in the order of the learned Single Judge clearly show that there was no quorum in the meeting held on 28.05.2007 in which the amendments had been carried out.\n16.  It was also demonstrated that manipulations/manoeuvrings is writ large that Principal in connivance with the outgoing Bishop, in order to perpetuate themselves in the Society have made amendments for their benefit and to the disadvantage of the Society and therein Dioces Education Board and the Bishop have been deliberately kept at bay. After saying so, the learned Single Judge correctly concluded that in such a situation and in this background, any interference with the order of the Assistant Registrar would amount to perpetuating the illegality and subscribing to apparent illegality committed.\n16.   The above-said order of the learned Single Judge was challenged before the Division Bench by way of Special Appeal No. 281 of 2011 which was also dismissed on 25.03.2011. The Bench has also arrived at a conclusion that there was interpolation and forgery in the records. The basic feature of the Society along with its primary object had been altered by way of amendments to the Rules. The Division Bench has accepted that the Assistant Registrar had the jurisdiction not only to deal with the validity of the convening of the meeting but also to examine the import of the resolution regarding the amendments of the Rules. The Division Bench has also agreed with the conclusion that the appellant No. 2 was not a member of the Society but was holding the office of the Secretary by virtue of being the Principal of the Boys' High School, Allahabad.\n17.   The Division Bench has also accepted that the meetings in which the amendments were carried out had not been validly convened. The Division Bench has pointed out that the minutes of these three meetings have also been registered on 30.05.2007 by the Assistant Registrar and by the impugned order dated 24.07.2010, he cancelled the registration. Ultimately, the Division Bench has rightly concluded that all other proceedings had been illegal and the meetings were in violation of the statutory provisions. The Division Bench, in view of its findings held that the meetings itself had not been validly convened as per the Rules of the Society and concluded that the orders passed by the Assistant Registrar and the learned Single Judge do not warrant any interference.\n18.   It is also brought to our notice that a criminal prosecution has also been lodged against the appellant No. 2 by filing an FIR dated 09.03.2010 in Crime No. 54 of 2010 under Sections 467, 468, 471, 420 and 409 IPC in which chargesheet has already been filed on 11.07.2010 and the court has also taken cognizance of the same.\n19.   In the light of the factual findings by the authority concerned-the Assistant Registrar, affirming the same by learned Single Judge and Division Bench, it is impermissible for this Court to exercise jurisdiction under Article 136 of the Constitution. It is relevant to point out that the Assistant Registrar, in his order dated 24.07.2010 itself permitted the Bishop, Diocese of Lucknow, who is an ex-officio member of the Society and Chairman of the Governing Body under the Rules, to convene a general body meeting after informing all the members about the present situation and circumstances and reasons, there is no valid ground for interference by this Court. Consequently, appeal fails and the same is dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed\n"}, {"document_id": 5, "content": "Daewoo Motors India Ltd. v Union of India and others\nSupreme Court of India\n\n20 February 2003\nAppeal (civil)  1502-1503 of 2003\nThe Order of the Court was as follows :\nLeave is granted.\n1.  These appeals arise from a common judgement of the High Court at Delhi in Civil Miscellaneous No. 6714 of 2002 in Civil Writ Petition No. 2002 of 2002 dated July, 16, 2002.\n2.  The controversy in these appeals relates to the encashment of the bank guarantee by the Union of India, the first respondent. As an import policy during the period 1995-1996, the first respondent introduced an \"Export Promotion Capital Goods (E.P.C.G.) Scheme. The Scheme envisaged exemption from custom duty on the imported goods, plants and equipment, etc., subject to the conditions incorporated in Exemption Notification No. 111/95-CUS dated 5th June, 1995 which was issued under Section 25(1) of the Customs Act, 1962. The appellant in the appeals arising out of S.L.P. (C) Nos. 14657-14658 of 2002, M/s. Daewoo Motors India Limited, availed the Scheme which, inter alia, provided that upon importing plants and equipment, it should fulfil the export obligation equivalent to six times the CIF value of the goods which had been imported on FOB basis, or alternatively four times the CIF value of the goods imported on net foreign exchange basis within a period of eight months. The period was divided into different blocks. Agreeing to fulfil the export obligation, the appellant obtained various import licences in respect of which bank guarantees were furnished by it from various banks, one of them being the Times Bank Limited, now H.D.F.C. Bank Limited, which is the appellant in the appeal arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 15022 of 2002. It appears that in respect of CIF value of Rupees one hundred crore and more, period to fulfil the export obligation was extended. But later, the Deputy Director General of Foreign Trade, by communication dated February 25, 2002, revoked the export obligation extension period and invoked various bank guarantees.\n3.  The appellant-company filed writ petition in the High Court at Delhi challenging the validity of the said order invoking the bank guarantee. The High Court took the view that as the writ petition involved disputed questions of fact and as the subject-matter related to encashment of bank guarantee, it would not be appropriate to exercise extra-ordinary jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution. It also observed that the order impugned before the High Court was an appealable order and in that view also, the writ petition ought not to be entertained. The writ petition was, thus, dismissed on July 16, 2002. It is against the correctness of this order that the present appeals have been preferred.\n4.  Insofar as the CIF value of the licences exceeding Rupees one hundred crores are concerned, this court granted stay of encashment of bank guarantee but in respect of the licences having CIF value of less than Rupees one hundred crore, the first respondent was at liberty to encash the bank guarantee. In the present appeals, we are concerned only with the licences where the CIF value exceeds Rupees one hundred crore.\n5.  Mr. S.K. Chowdhary, learned counsel appearing for the appellant company contends that in respect of the licences of CIF value exceeding Rupees one hundred crores, the period for compliance of the export obligation was extended and as such the first respondent cannot be permitted to encash the bank guarantee when ample time is available to the appellant-company to discharge the export obligation. It was pleaded that in view of the critical financial position of the company, there have been negotiations to sell the assets altogether and if, at this stage, the bank guarantees are allowed to be encashed, the company would be put to great hardships and irreparable loss.\n6.  Mr. P. Chidambaram, learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant- Bank, has argued that having regard to the wording of the bank guarantee furnished by the bank to the first respondent, it is a conditional guarantee and as there is enough time to fulfil the export obligation, the bank guarantee cannot be encashed, except by an arbitrary action of the first respondent.\n7.  Mr. Soli J. Sorabjee, the learned Attorney General appearing for the first respondent, on the other hand, submits that the extension of time has been revoked, thus, the very foundation on which the company is resting its defence is not available to it. He contends that the Bank has no locus, no cause of action has accrued to it to file the appeal and/or to contest the invocation of the bank guarantee.\n8.  The short point that arises for our consideration is, whether the impugned order of the High Court dismissing the writ petition of the appellant- company warrants any interference in exercise of the jurisdiction of this Court under Article 136 of the Constitution.\n9.  It is too well-settled a proposition to admit of detailed reasoning that for encashment of bank guarantee, the bank cannot have any valid resistance, except, of course, in a case of fraud. The clause in the bank guarantee, on which Mr. Chidambaram relies, reads as under:\n\"We Times Bank Ltd., PTI Building, Parliament Street, New Delhi-110001 do hereby unconditionally and irrevocably agree to pay the President of India on Demand without any demur or protest the amount due and payable under the above said bond not exceeding Rs. 4,80,000 Rupees Four crore eighty lac only by way of loss or damage caused or suffered by the President of India by reason of non-fulfilment of the export obligation under the above said Notification or by reason of any breach of any of the terms and conditions of the above said bond by M/s. DAEWOO MOTORS INDIA LIMITED.\"\n10.  He has emphasised on the words \"by reason of non-fulfillment of the export obligation under the above said Notification\" and argued that as there is no case of default or non-fulfilment of the export obligation as there is ample time, at any rate till 2004, so the first respondent is not entitled to invoke the bank guarantee. We are afraid, we cannot accede to the contention of the learned senior counsel. The words quoted above, cannot be read in isolation by dissociating them from the context in which they have been used. A reading of the bank guarantee as a whole and the above extracted paragraphs in particular leaves us in no speck of doubt that those words only qualify the preceding words, \"loss or damage caused or suffered by the President of India\", and do not constitute a condition precedent for the first respondent to invoke the bank guarantee, much less they give any cause of action to the bank to contest the encashment of the bank guarantee on the ground of there being no non-fulfilment of the export obligation.\n11.  Further, it would be appropriate to read here the following clauses of the bank guarantee.\n\"We Times Bank Ltd. PTI Building, Parliament Street, New Delhi, 110001 further agree that the demand made by the President of India any money so demanded notwithstanding any dispute raised by M/s. Daewoo Motors India Ltd. in any proceeding before any Court or Tribunal; We Times Bank Ltd., PTI Building, Parliament Street, New Delhi-110001 further agree that the demand made by the President of India shall be conclusive as regards the amount due and payable by us under these presents as out of liability under these presents are absolute and unequivocal.\"\n12.  From a perusal of the above clauses, it is abundantly clear that the bank guarantee furnished by the bank is an unconditional and absolute bank guarantee. The bank has rendered itself liable to pay the cash on demand by the President of India \"notwithstanding any dispute raised by M/s. Daewoo Motors India Limited in any proceeding before any Court or Tribunal\". It is worth noticing that the clause in the bank guarantee specifically provides that the demand made by the President of India shall be conclusive as regards the amount due and payable by the bank under this guarantee and the liability under the guarantee is absolute and unequivocal. In the face of the clear averments, it is trite to contend that the bank guarantee is a conditional bank guarantee. Therefore, the bank has no case to resist the encashment of the bank guarantee. Inasmuch as we have held that the bank guarantee is an unconditional bank guarantee, the case M/s. Hindustan Construction Company Limited, v. State of Bihar and Ors., reported in [1999] 8 SCC 436 1999 Indlaw SC 29 is of no avail to the appellant.\n13.  It is true that the bank guarantee has to be read in conjunction with the terms of the contract but when the bank itself is in absolute terms, the agreement between the company and the first respondent would be of no avail to the bank.\n14.  Insofar as the contention of the appellant-company is concerned, firstly, the order extending the export obligation period has been revoked. Even assuming that the revocation is not a valid revocation, the fact remains that the plant of the appellant-company has been closed down; the entire production of the appellant-company has come to an end. It is also on record that public notices have been issued for auctioning the plant of the appellant-company by the company itself. In such circumstances, when there is no apparent possibility of the fulfilment of the export obligation, the appellant-company cannot seek refuge under the extended period. In our considered view, when it becomes apparent on the facts and circumstances of the case that there is no chance of the appellant fulfilling its export obligation, the action of the first respondent in invoking the bank guarantee cannot be said to be premature and unjustified, much less arbitrary and illegal so as to warrant any interference by this Court.\n15.  For the above-mentioned reasons, the appeals fail. They are, accordingly, dismissed. In the facts and circumstances of the case, we make no order as to costs.\nAppeals dismissed\n"}]
