    When a lawyer is presented with a situation (that will potentially lead to filing
of a case), it will be very beneficial to him/her if there is an automatic system
that identifies a set of related prior cases involving similar situations as well
as statutes/acts that can be most suited to the purpose in the given situation.
Such a system shall not only help a lawyer but also benefit a common man,
in a way of getting a preliminary understanding of the legal aspects pertaining
to a situation, even before he/she approaches a lawyer. The system can assist
him/her in identifying where his/her legal problem fits, what legal actions he/she
can proceed with (through statutes) and what were the outcomes of similar cases
(through precedents).
