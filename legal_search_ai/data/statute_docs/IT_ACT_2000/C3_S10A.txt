CHAPTER 3
ELECTRONIC GOVERNANCE

10A. Validity of contracts formed through electronic means

Where in a contract formation, the communication of proposals, the acceptance of
proposals, the revocation or proposals and acceptances, as the case may be, are expressed
in electronic form or by means of an electronic record, such contract shall not be deemed
to be unenforceable solely on the ground that such electronic form or means was used for
that purpose.
