CHAPTER 10
THE [[ X X X ] APPELLATE TRIBUNAL]

63. Compounding of contraventions

(1) Any contravention under this [Act] may, either before or after the institution of
adjudication proceedings, be compounded by the Controller or such other officer as
may be specially authorised by him in this behalf or by the adjudicating officer, as the
case may be, subject to such conditions as the Controller or such other officer or the
adjudicating officer may specify :
Provided that such sum shall not, in any case, exceed the maximum amount of the
penalty which may be imposed under this Act for the contravention so compounded.
(2) Nothing in sub-section (1) shall apply to a person who commits the same or
similar contravention within a period of three years from the date on which the first
contravention, committed by him, was compounded.
Explanation.For the purposes of this sub-section, any second or subsequent
contravention committed after the expiry of a period of three years from the date on
which the contravention was previously compounded shall be deemed to be a first
contravention.
(3) Where any contravention has been compounded under sub-section (1), no
proceeding or further proceeding, as the case may be, shall be taken against the
person guilty of such contravention in respect of the contravention so compounded.

OBJECTS AND REASONS
Clause 63. This clause provides that any contravention under the Act shall be
compounded by the Controller or adjudication officer either before or after the institution
of the adjudication proceedings subject to such conditions he may impose.
